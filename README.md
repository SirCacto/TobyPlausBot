# "Capturing the Soul of Toby Plaus"

![1767929520001](image/README/RomanceInItalyLogo.png "Romance in Italy")

Welcome! I've created a chatbot based on the character Toby from my old book, *Romance in Italy*. While it's still far from perfect in its current state, I believe I've made substantial progress through its different variations.

You can talk to Toby yourself! The Streamlit website is listed on the repository, but I'll also provide the link at the bottom of this file.

I also did a writeup of my process! This can be found at /Report/Toby Plaus Model Project Report.pdf, but I'll also provide the link at the bottom of this file.

The code for the Streamlit app can be found at /app.py.

*Romance in Italy* is provided in the repository as well, albeit in a cleaned form. This is to say, headers for chapters have been removed, and the way that character perspectives change (ex. "-Luke-") has been swapped out for a more obvious indicator for the model to understand. I don't plan on linking back to the original Google Doc or PDF of *Romance in Italy* at this time, but the whole book is in the repository under /Library/Romance_In_Italy.txt. Keep in mind that the book was unfinished, so don't expect a satisfying ending. And... maybe don't read that last Luke section. I was 15 when I wrote it. But, nevertheless, I'll also link *Romance in Italy* at the bottom of this file. There are a couple of typos in this version of the book, but, hey, it's still a free book.

Toby's "Bible" and questions are stored at /Library/toby_bible.txt and /Library/toby_questions.txt, respectively.

Enjoy talking to Toby!

#### Where to Start With Toby

* The report has a quick overview of the plot, so you can take topics from that! However, here are some things you can ask the bot!

  * Who are your friends?
  * Do you miss Bella?
  * Are you friends with Ed?
  * Tell me about Faith Creek!
  * Do you miss Caleb?
  * Tell me about the music you've composed!

  As mentioned above, you can read all of *Romance in Italy* if you'd like! However, all of the chapter headers are gone, so make sure you don't lose your spot!
